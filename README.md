# 💸 Splitwise Clone  
### Building a Scalable Expense Sharing App in SwiftUI

> 🚀 Not just a clone.  
> A production-thinking, architecture-driven iOS project.

This project is my deep dive into building a real-world scalable expense sharing app inspired by Splitwise — engineered with modern iOS standards, clean architecture, and long-term maintainability in mind.

---

## 🎯 Vision

To build an **offline-first, scalable, modular expense management system** using:

- Modern SwiftUI  
- Clean Architecture  
- SOLID principles  
- Swift Concurrency  
- Real-world engineering patterns  

This is not a UI demo.  
This is an architecture playground.

## ✅ Current Build

### 🏠 Home Dashboard

- Expense listing  
- Search functionality  
- Smart filtering logic  
- State-driven SwiftUI updates  
- Clean, modular UI components

## 🏗 Engineering Philosophy

This project follows:

- Feature-based modular structure  
- MVVM + Repository pattern  
- Protocol-driven design  
- Dependency Injection  
- SOLID Principles  
- Scalable folder architecture  
- Offline-first thinking  

Future-ready. Interview-ready. Production-ready.

## 💡 Why This Project?

Because real engineering is not about screens.  
It’s about:

- Scalability  
- Code clarity  
- Separation of concerns  
- Maintainability  
- Performance  
- Thoughtful architecture  

This project is where I experiment, break things, refactor, and level up.
